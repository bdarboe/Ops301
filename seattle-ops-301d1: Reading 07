Network Segmentation
It is the division of networks into segments to be able to put endpoints into different groups. 
This is important to separate departments and protect them from unauthorized access to files 
and other resources belonging to their respective departments. 

In the case of an outside attack, network segmentation can prevent the attack from spreading 
to other areas and departments by preventing access to other areas. This helps the 
administrator to narrow down the area of the attack and quickly resolve the problem to bring 
the systems back into full operation. 

Network segmentation can be very profitable for an organization by prevent the unnecessary 
use of applications which may be too expensive to run. The practice of network segmentation 
also helps organizations to properly and effectively monitor their network and boost 
performance where necessary.
