End Point Acquisition


The widespread of technology couldnâ€™t be obvious than it is in this generation.  Traditionally, endpoints are usually clustered in one area and the resources needed to be accessed in that area alone. 

Nowadays, devices and resources are scattered around the globe and can be easily connected to facilitate effective and efficient communication and resource sharing than traditional siloed stations. Nonetheless, with easy comes the cost of security. In the interest of the organization, endpoint agent are leveraged to provide the comfort and security needed to ensure that people continue to distribute resources around the globe without worry of data loss or theft. 

Endpoints agents provide real time detection of unauthorize intruders and block them from gaining access to the network system therefore protecting the organization.

Operationg System (OS) hardening is also another measure implemented to provide security for our systems. OS hardening is to reduce the areas that may be available to attacks to make it difficult for attacks to take place. Installations should be secured, unwanted programs deleted, storage devices and data sent and receive over networks encrypted, keep up with updates, proper configure BIOS, and implement a very strong Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) are all ways of provide strong security for our data and network systems.
