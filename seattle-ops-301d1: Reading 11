                                                  Microsoft Azure

Windows Azure formerly known as Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing environment such as Amazon 
Web Services and Google. Cloud computing which has gain popularity in recent times, is not just a data 
storage on some storage facilities in a remote area, but a collection of computers on which different 
computing services run. 

Instead of businesses and organizations spend a lot of money on file servers, email servers, web servers 
and other services, they can simply pay for the exact amount of service they need on Microsoft Azure to 
access these services. These eliminates waste in terms of purchasing more hardware than you need and 
hiring IT personnel to main the hardware. 

Microsoft Azure enables the user to run virtual machines in the cloud including a Linux desktop. 

Azure Active Directory, Azure AD can run just like it runs on a Windows server in organizations to 
manage and secure their systems. All these services makes it easy for organizations to host services and 
develop applications. 

                                                  IDENTITY MANAGEMENT
                                                  
Enabling users to access the system by providing some form of identification is part of the many security 
measures that organizations take to protect information and data. By the use of Azure AD user 
identification can be easily managed. Azure enables changes to be made to one part of the system for 
example a change in one group can be applied to the rest of the groups. Azure AD also allows for a single
sign-on – SS0. 

In Azure, the use of separate identity source is recommended for third-party accounts to prevent direct 
access to the system. 

Azure AD makes securing the organization’s system easy for the support team and it is highly 
recommended for organizations.
