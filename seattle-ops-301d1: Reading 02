Networking

Networking in the computer world can be defined as the connection of two or more computers to establish communication and resource sharing. However, other devices such as printers and scanners can be added to the network, although these devices can be considered as computers in the computing world. Some components such as routers, switches, modems have to be put together for a proper networking environment to be established.  
The network components can be connected to form different types of networks such as LAN, WAN, WLAN, CAN, PAN Etc. These network types uses network protocols such as TCP/IP to send and receive information among devices commonly referred to as nodes. The nodes are basically the end points in the network system where the user interaction or data interactivity may occur. Different types of cables may be used to connect nodes, but Ethernet cable are more commonly used to connect devices. 
The connection of devices is done following certain topologies depending on the need of the individual or organization. For example: Bus topology, ring topology, star topology, and mesh topology. Star is the most commonly used due to its efficiency and itâ€™s cheaper than a mesh. Star topology, unlike bus and ring topologies, can also function if one of the nodes goes down. The internet is a typical example of a mesh topology to create redundancy for continuous uptime. 
Security of a network is very important to prevent unauthorized access to important information. Firewalls are properly configured and used in order to block intruders from accessing the network. 
In conclusion, a network system, wired or wireless, have made it easy to communicate and share information around the world.
