ROUTING
Routing â€“ a process performed by devices in the layer 3 of the OSI model to deliver packets
from one network to the other. 

Routing has three types: Static, Default, and Dynamic. Each of the types has their advantages 
and disadvantages and different types of configurations. For example, static routing has the 
advantage of no bandwidth usage between routers, which can be very useful in a scenario 
where bandwidth is needed for more important issues at a particular moment. However, 
manually adding routes can be very difficult and time consuming for large companies.

In default routing, one router may be configured to send packets to a single router, irrespective 
of which network the packets belong. This will speed up the distribution process without having 
to figure out where to send the packets. 

In Dynamic routing, the ease to configure removes the complexity that other router comes with 
making it difficult to troubleshoot as well. However, it consumes a lot of bandwidth in 
communicating with others. 

OSPF

A link-state routing protocol where routers exchange topology information with the nearest 
routers. The advantage to OSPF is that the routers are able to calculate routes to satisfy a 
particular criteria due to the topology knowledge they possess.
