IAC – Infrastructure as Code

Traditionally, physical infrastructures have been at the core of our network and server needs. 
When we need to make changes, we have to either deploy a VM or install a physical server to 
connect users and distribute resources. However, with the advent of cloud services, the physical 
deployment of servers are becoming a thing of the past. Servers can be deploy on a cloud 
infrastructure within minutes and users can access the resource right away. Although this 
seems to be done somewhere in space, the cloud system is actually a network of physical 
structures hosted by organizations who have the ability to setup large datacenters to deploy these services. 

Cloud gives DevOps Engineers the ability to automate process that would have otherwise been done 
manually. Cloud makes enables organizations to save money by on paying for what they use and use what they pay for.
