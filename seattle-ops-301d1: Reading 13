Patch Management

As computer systems become part who we are and how we execute our daily tasks, the risk to be attacked 
and be left disabled also presents itself. Software that run on our systems are not perfect and needs 
to be improved periodically to improve performance and provide security to our systems. 

Patch management is a software code used to improve an installed program or application. It’s like a 
bandage to seal an opening or vulnerability in the application. Malware can be used by attackers to 
penetrate systems that aren’t properly patched and gain access to valuable information. 

Patches are usually categorized into three categories: feature patches which is mostly to 
improve the performance and capability of the application, bug fix patches which fixes an 
error that the application may have come with, and security patches that fixes a vulnerability in the application. 

Patch management can be difficult if it has to be done manually especially in large organizations. 
Automated patch management can be easily implement for patches to be deployed without interruption. 
The benefits of automated patching are increased productivity since the patches may be monitored in the 
IT department and patches will be deployed on time to avoid security breaches. Full compliance is 
also attained with automated patch management to make sure all systems are up to date on their 
patches, and your system will also be secured. 

Although the patching itself is important, the right tools and procedures should be used before the 
deployment of patches. 

The WSUS server is used to acquire updates from Microsoft for distribution or patching to your system. 
Organizations should have one WSUS that does the automation of patch management to improve and secure the system.
