DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

DMZ is a setup in the network that has a very low security setup. Usually a firewall is placed 
between the DMZ and the rest of the network to create an extra layer or two, if a second 
firewall is involved, of security. 

In setting up DMZs, web servers can be placed in the DMZ but sensitive parts of the system 
such as mail servers that stores users login credentials and FTP(File Transfer Protocol) which 
host critical contents on company sites. 

To design a simple DMZ, a single firewall may be used but for a stronger or more secure 
approach, two firewalls may be configured to create a formidable protection of the system and 
keep intruders away. 

A web server which can be used in a DMZ setup can be either a hardware or software. It is a 
computer that runs web server software. Web servers enables internet users to access 
webpages through HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) which is the less secure version of the 
HTTPS where the S stands for secure.
