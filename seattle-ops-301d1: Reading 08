Active Directory (AD)

AD as it fondly referred to by technicians, is a set of five Windows services that run on the server to manage permissions and access to the network resources. 
AD Domain Services (AD DS), AD Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), AD Federation Services (AD FS), AD Certificate Services (AD CS), 
AD Rights Management Services (AD RMS) are the five services but AD DS is the most commonly used service of them all and it is mostly called AD. 

AD DS stores information in a directory in the form of objects with attached attributes. AD enables administrators to create workgroups in small networking 
environments but in large networking environments where hundreds or thousands of computers are used, a client-server system is used to enable endpoints to access 
and share network resources. 

Athough it may sometimes be referred to as a database due to it ability to store information, its read operation characteristics as oppose to write characteristics 
made it an authentic directory. 

In AD, an Organizational Unit (OU) is a structure that helps creating units within a domain. Sub OUs can be created within major OUs in order to create more 
efficiency in the management of the domain to improve the organizationâ€™s bottom line. When designing OUs, answering some key questions will help in the 
design process. 

Taking all aspects of design will give us the benefit of managing objects efficiently and delegating administrative control to other users in other locations.
