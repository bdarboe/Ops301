DIVERSITY IN THE TECH INDUSTRY

May be the video game industry is the one to blame for lack of diversity, but 
may be the issue of diversity actually came from the minds that built those games in the 
first place. Because the industry saw the whole idea of gaming as a male thing, they decided to 
alienate a whole gender who are half of the world's population. 

The marketing of the games and to an extent other tech products are biased againt women in general. 
Technology is generally seen as a man thing especially in colleges where very few women take up technology 
as a field of study and those who do are mostly in computer science - very few. 

The industry does need to take diversity seriously and hiring managers should move away from their
implicite biases that do not serve their companies well. Apart from the women issue, people from minority groups
experience a poor representation in the tech industry. The underrepresentation of minority groups starts in colleges
where very few go into the STEM fields because of the perception that they're not good enough. Most minority students 
end taking non-STEM fields which may not serve them well and the professors unfortunately seem to ok with 
the lack of diversity and that needs to change.
